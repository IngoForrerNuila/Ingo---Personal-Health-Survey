# Ingo---Personal-Health-Survey
Create a demo online survey that asks questions concerning the personal health of the current visitor and finally gives feedback or recommendations about the given information.

The Form itself was planed to give a very friendly and good loocking way to our users to get some feed back regarding their health. Depending on the information provided by our users the reulst might change, giving different recommendations or feed back. In this project I had different problems that would be explained in the "Obstacle File" however the idea of providing recommendations for improving people's health is fantastic.
