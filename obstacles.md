The first Obstacles I found at the moment of creating the website was validating the input fields, I was able to validate the very 3 question pages in order let know our users about filling out the labels properly. Unfortunately the rest of the pages were not responding and letting our users going through each page without selecting an option or answering our questions.

The second Obstacle I found was getting the information selected or provided by our users, for some reason I was not able to to get the users answers in Question 3 (page 3) the site is not printing it.

Third Obstacle were writing errors, that is something I battle with Chris when we were trying to fix a problem with the Slider Validation.

Unfotunately I was not able to complete a result page, I had not more time in order to understand the code related with the result or feedback site and provide a nice ending to this project.

Another obstacle I had because of my lack of understanding and time was not giving a good visual. I do not really like the visuals of this website, If I were able to work more in this project of course I would be enhancing this point. The project itself lools like a beta instead of a demo.

Difficulties I had in this project in general terms was "Speed" I was not enough fast with the visual aspect of the project and coding, something I need to improve and manage in the properly in the next project.
